    <td>The learning strategies that were effective were taking down notes so that i had references when i was making my website and I knew what websites could help me. Another effective strategy was asking my peers as they had good ideas</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The way my learning was limited was that i spent a lot of time helping others with their website and discussing ideas, rather than working on my own website.</td>
