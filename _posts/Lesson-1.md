  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening and taking notes on my ipad on the notes app. I found this really useful as I couldn't hold all the information in my brain and I can go back and use this information later on. Another effective strategy was talking to my peers and helping each other with bits that we were confident in.</td>
